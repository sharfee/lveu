        <h2>Dear Shafiya,</h2>
        <h3>
            I don’t know how to say this but I love you. 
            After getting to know you over the past few years, 
            I’ve fallen for you. I’m sorry that I’m so awkward and shy when 
            I’m around you, it’s because I don’t know how to react to someone 
            so genuine and kind and amazing as you. I’m sorry that 
            I stopped talking to you and closed you out because 
            I was afraid I might ruin our friendship if I said something stupid but instead 
            I did do something stupid by stop talking to you and now we don’t even talk anymore 
            because instead of trying to protect our friendship, I ended it without even knowing. 
            I wish I had the guts to come up and talk to you but I always get these butterflies in 
            my stomach when I see you and I’m always afraid if I make the first move, you might think 
            I’m annoying or that I’m coming on too strong but when I did make the first move by texting you hi, 
            I felt like you didn’t even notice and I didn’t know what to do when you didn’t respond. 
            My friends tell me you look at me during class and that you like me but 
            I never think of it as anything because I either think you’re 
            looking at a window or at a prettier girl sitting behind me  me because 
            I always think that there are so many other girls who are prettier and less 
            awkward than me so why would you ever choose me but I guess that I won’t ever 
            know that unless a miracle happens. I apologize if I never notice your first moves 
            either because I’m so uncertain with love that I need someone to come up to me and 
            tell me they like me before I know for sure they like me so I’m sorry for not catching 
            your subtle hints if there was any. I guess what I’m trying to say is you’re a pretty amazing
             guy and that I hope one day I can be with someone as amazing and makes my heart flutter just like you. 
             I love you Shafiya.
