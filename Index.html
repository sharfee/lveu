        <h2>Dear Shafiya,</h2>
        <h3>
            Though I cannot see you right now, 
            I can picture your smile and the big dimple on your left cheek.
            I want to be on your side right now. Sometimes, tears of passion overflow before my eyes because
            I think about you day and night; 
            I can’t stop reminiscing about the good times we shared. 
            I hope I can be where you are now and tell you how important you are to me; 
            you have changed my life. Since the day I met you, my heart has been filled with love, 
            passion, and peace. Indeed, my love for you will continue to grow until the end of time.<br>
            
            I swear my heart skipped its beat. From that Evening  on, 
            I realized that we were destined to be together. 
            I love you far more than you can imagine. 
            I need you to remain mine forever. I love you so much SHAFIYA ❤.
